Zombie Slayer

In the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, what remains of humanity has to reclaim that which was lost. With limited resources they have to thin the zombie horde, one surgical strike at a time. That is when they send in the zombie slayer.

Gameplay: The player is teleported into battle with an endless horde of zombies emerging from the sides of the screen. The amount of active zombies on the screen slowly increases, so the player has to keep their numbers down as to not get overwhelmed. Supply crates are teleported in at set intervals of slain zombies, and the player can choose between regenerating back to full health, or pick one of three random upgrades. At the same time, there is a chance that the zombie horde grows in power; it can grow tougher, hit harder, or grow stronger. The horde's threat level is shown by the Threat Level Indicator in the top-right corner of the screen. In the later stage of the game, the option to regenerate back to full health is replaced with calling in a teleport beacon. If the beacon is selected then the player has to survive one final round of zombies before they can escape from the battle and win the game. During battle, the player has to keep track of their ammunition; if they try to fire their weapon when they are out of ammo, it will overheat, and reload will take twice as long compared to reloading manually.

Zombie Slayer has the following features:
- Sound can be turned on and off
- The three highest scores, as well as whether sound should be on or off, are automatically saved
- Highscores can be reset
- 9 upgrades that can aid the player during the game, plus full health regeneration and calling for a teleport beacon
- Up to 64 hostile zombies can be on the screen at the same time
- Simple intro sequence, and a victory cutscene

The upgrades the player has access to are:
- Health Up: Increase maximum HP by 2, and regain 2 HP.
- Armour Up: Reduce the damage the player suffers from zombies. If damage suffered would be less than 1, a die is rolled to determine if the player is harmed or not.
- Shield Duration Up: If the player suffers damage, an energy shield kicks in with a duration of 0.5 seconds to give them a chance to get out of danger. This upgrade increases the shield's duration with 0.16 seconds.
- Damage Up: Increases the damage of the player's projectiles. If the zombies ever get tougher than the player's projectiles are strong, there's a chance that they will simply shrug off the blast and continue advancing towards the player.
- Penetration Up: This upgrade allows the player's projectiles to pass through struck zombies and hit the ones further back. Each time this upgrade is chosen, the player's projectiles can pass through up to 1 additional zombie.
- Ammo Up: Increase the player's maximum ammo by 4, and immediately reload weapon for free.
- Reload Up: Speeds up reloading.
- Horde Size Down: Reduce the number of zombies by half. Already active zombies will still remain on screen, but they won't respawn after being slain.
- Horde Increase Slowed: The zombie horde grows constantly during gameplay. This upgrade slows that growth.

The zombie horde can be empowered in the following ways:
- Horde Size Up: Increase the number of active zombies by 10.
- Zombie Toughness Up: The zombies become more difficult to slay.
- Zombie Damage Up: The zombies hit harder when they reach the player.
